# My extracts from Blinkist:
Compared to human, AI needs to take a lot more data input to internalize some concepts, which is the limitation of Deep Learning. So the author mentioned a hybird system that used to develop the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). The author thinks AI can make everyone's life better and also warn us about the risk of weaponized AI (like drone or autonomous weapons). The end, the author also mentioned that UBI could be the solution to the problem of job automation. 

# My key takeawys
This book is based on interviews of 20+ engineers and scientists working in AI field which reveals some advanced technologies, including (Affectiva)[https://www.affectiva.com/], (semanticscholar)[https://www.semanticscholar.org/]. I share the same idea that AI will aid a lot in healthcare industry. For starters, AI can help doctors to read radiographies quickly, conduct quick checkups and tests, etc. This could free doctors to focus on the patient's emotion. Secondly, some AI powered therapy pets (Like Palo) can comfort senior citizens with dementia.  


# Some sentenancs/ words to note:
1. eradicate 根除；杜绝
2. autism 自闭症
3. stipend 尤指神职人员、教师和公务员的
4. hotly 激烈地
5. 

# Summary
I like this book and will read this one later this year. (***)
