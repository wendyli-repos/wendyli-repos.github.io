<!--excerpt.start-->It is quite often to use Mac OS Terminal to run some command for programming. Here are some notes that I can reference back anytime.<!--excerpt.end-->
  

# Environment Variable
## To check current environment variable
```sh
$ printenv
```
## To open environment variable
Open and edit environment variable in a `nano` editor.  
```sh
# ensure pwd is the root directory
$ nano .bash_profile
```  
The alternation is to open in a `vi` editor.  
```sh
# ensure pwd is the root directory
$ nano .bash_profile
```  
## To save changes in `.bash_profile`, press `Control` + `O`.  
## TO exit `nano` editor, press `Control` + `X`.
