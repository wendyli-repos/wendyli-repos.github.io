# My extracts from Blinkist:
1. The author compared the trend of using more AI to the use of steam engine in the nineteenth-century. The author provided a valid point that the Industrial Revolution introduced steam engine which empowers machines' abilities in working more effectively. This freed human beings from works producing raw material (like agriculture products) to providing services (like teachers, services workers, etc). 
2. More and more people switching careers to services sections marked the start of Information Revolution. The author drew an analogy between steam engines and AI. AI empowered our previous non-intellectual equipment with analysis and autonomous abilities akin to stream engines harness machines on the assembly line. 
3. The author's opinion is that "machines increases the wealth of nations and do not threaten human employment". The author also provided some statistics from Deloitte (2015) to support his opinion. 
4. The author introduced a software [Quill](https://www.quill.org/) which is developed by Narrative Science in 2010. This software can generate article structure and compose the necessary sentences based on some inputs of short phrases. 
5. The author provided another example [Paro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJq5PQZHU-I), which is a robot looks like a small seal with fur and big eyes. 
6. The author mentioned that suddenly increased unemployment rates caused by AI taking over people's job will lead to economic contraction and "may widen the divide between social classes". 
7. The author also mentioned that UBI could be the solution but joblessness will cause psychological side-effects.  

# My key takeawys
1. Labor intensive jobs will become less if AI has been introduced more broadly in factories, assembly lines, agriculture industries.
2. Keep one's knowledge and skills up to the speed of Information Revolution is the best way to better fit in the future society. 
3. Learn to adapt to a world with AI being part of life.
