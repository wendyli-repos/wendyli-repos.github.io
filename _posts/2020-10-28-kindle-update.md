I encountered an error when trying to use Kindle (4th Generation, Black) to download docs. The error message is like "You device is out of the range ... and restart..". After some searches, I found below solutions:  
Step 1: Check kindle version from this [page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW);  
Step 2: Because my Kindle(4th)'s version is 4.1.1 so I need to first upgrade to 4.1.2 then gradually to 4.1.4. Then I visit this [page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX3VVAQS4DYDE5KE#GUID-4C9EFFF2-2B4E-4DB8-997D-6DC9B3566220__SECTION_5EB1B42C0CCF40E5A0DD8E64F7AAEF8A) to download the `Software Update` file;  
Step 3: Connect kindle to PC and copy the download file to Kindle;  
Step 4: Eject Kindle and disconnect USB cable;  
Step 5: On Kindle, press Menu -> Setting -> Menu (again) -> Update device;  
Step 6: It will take a few minutes for Kindle to complete the upgrade and you just leave it done its thing;  
Step 7: All good now and any docs sent to your Kindle are shown in this device.  

I also found this (youtube video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch/InuAX7gOFOg] illustrate the process.
