# My extracts from Blinkist:
1. The author introduced the history of grid in America. From a grid that can power only one bulb to a dozen of bulbs; from direct current to alternate current that can transfer 20 miles with less power loss. 
2. The author also mentioned the monopolization of electricity supply. "As a result, as the 1920s came to close, just ten holding business ran a solid 75 percent of the entire American electricity industry, thereby realizing Insull's dream of a monopoly. 
3. The author also mentioned some pressing problems old grids are facing due to aging and cumbersome infrastructure. One main reason is newly implemented legislation (like Energy Policy Act) requires separation of electricity production and distribution. This legislation challenged energy companies both in terms of organization and finances. 
4. To distribute electricity effectively, smart meters are installed but consumers are concerned their privacy (like when is at home, which appliance is running or even which television channel is wating, etc.) could be violated.  
5. The author's suggestion is to design microgrids, or "islands" that can run independently to mitigate the shut down risk brought by inclement weather.  

# My key takeawys
1. Electricity grid evolved from powering one bulb to support our current modern lifestyles.
2. The invention of AC make electricity to transfer further with less loss. 
3. Smart meters could save money on utilities bills but in the risk of privacy.
4. Microgrids powered by solar, wind, or other resources could be the trend for future to supplement the macrogrids during inclement weather.  

# Some sentenancs/ words to note:
1. fraying
2. under strain
3. in dire straits financially
4. layoff

# Summary
A great book of the history of America grid. I feel like would like to read this book in the future. (***)
