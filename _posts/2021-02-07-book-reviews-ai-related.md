Below are my takeawasy on a few books talk about AI. I listened to blinkist of those books and recorded some of my takeaways and thoughts. No pacticular sequence. 

## 1. AI Superpowers (2018) by Kai-fu LEE

Synopsis from Blinkist:

> AI Superpowers (2018) takes a revealing look at the US and China as the world stands at the precipice of the AI economy, a multi-trillion dollar industry of algorithms and automation. As a tech expert and venture capitalist with experience in both China and the US, author Kai-Fu Lee guides us through the past to discover how we got to where we are and what to expect in the future.  

### My extracts from Blinkist:
1. AI is originated from Deep Learning. 
2. China has gone from copycat to top contender in past few years. An great example is "Meituan", founded by Wang Xin who is also the founder of the "Renren", also known as the "Facebook of China". Akin to "Groupon", "Meitun" is a platform where users can purchase vouchers at a lower price compared to retailer price in the shops. But "Meituan" deals not only foods and restaurants, but also other popular vendors like cinemas, spas, arcades, etc to suit local market better. 
3. There are one distinct difference between SV companies and Chinese companies which is as referred by the author, a light or heavy touch. SV companies usually focus on one purpose of their product, like Uber, started with car-sharing and kept this for a few years. While the counterpart "Didi" also focuses on petrol and repair services, which gave users more attachment to the app. 
4. Different means to access Internet Service is the core reason why China companies have a broader product range. Many people in China accessed the Internet using their smart phones (because it could be fairy cheap, like Xiaomi 1 sold at approx. U$200 in 2009). 
5. Chinese preferred to have a centralized app that can deal with all sorts of things, like Wechat. You can send msgs, transfer files and money, pay utilities bills, telephone bills, purchase from different vendors, even upload your Covid-19 test results (nowadays).
6. China is better at Internet AI, whereas USA is better at business AI. USA companies kept more business records compared to China companies, so USA is at a better position to implement business AI, like applying AI to loan applications. China has a great advantage on the large population which can generate enormous data in a few years and those data could be as the source to educate AI program. So the author thinks that China could outperform USA in the future. Some companies (like AntGroup) in China already used AI to analysis loan applications focusing on those who are underserved by traditional banks. 
8. perception AI (voice & facial recognition) VS autonomous AI. If you'd like to treat off some privacy to get a better user experience, my answer would be depends. 
9. If AI will create a utopia or dystopia? Maybe leave for the future to tell.
10. Further to Point 5, this may give SV a delusion that China companies could lose their focus on the core service, which leads to an inaccurate forecast on their performance.

### Below are some of my key takeaways and comments.   
<em>AI Superpowers</em> (2018) 是 Dr. Kai-fu LEE (李开复)写的一本对于 AI 在中、美两国的发展历史、行业现状和未来趋势的书。书的前半部分讲述了中国的 IT 产业发展史，从 90 年代末被成为“中国的 XXX”copy-cat，逐步转型到引领 AI 发展的行业先锋。这本书是先在喜马拉雅上听完中文有声书，根据记忆整理一下我的 takeaways：

1. 互联网行业在中国的发展是从 copy-cat 开始，从王鑫的人人网-中国的“Facebook”、卓越网-中国的“amazon”、美团网-中国的“Groupon”，等等到后来发展出来的滴滴、wechat、tiktok 等；
2. 中国的企业得到国家的大力扶持，包括硬性金融方便补助和一些软性补助，比如落户、孩子上学等，吸引了更多优秀的、dedicate 的技术人员从事互联网行业；
3. 这些政府补助不可避免地存在一些浪费和不能高效进行资本运作的缺点；
3. 中国的创业者和员工可以疯狂地工作以达到产出产品的目的；
4. 因为员工可以疯狂地工作，所以可以达到产品快速根据市场需求迭代、逐步丰富内容、更好地满足市场需求；
5. 90年代和2000年初进入中国的硅谷企业很难适应中国市场。根据作者观点加上我个人理解，我认为有3方面主要原因：
  原因一：对中国市场和用户使用习惯不了解，导致产品不能很好地本地化。
  原因二：中国市场对于硅谷企业是扩展市场，企业会习惯性套用之前的成功运作方案、产品，但是这些产品自带的属性为适应西方使用习惯，回到原因一。
  原因三：对政府政策了解不到位。
6. 作者分别对中、美二国AI的未来进行里展望，我个人认为这不是单独某个国家的发展，而是整个人类的问题，人类要如何面对AI应用对我们已经习惯的生活产生的影响。
7. 作者从自己患病(Stage IV lymphoma) 后治愈（remission）的经历中得到人与人沟通在人类社会里的不可替代性。AI医生可以快速阅读X-ray并进行诊断推测，但是AI（至少目前的AI）无法有人类医生的同情心（同理心）来通知患者诊断结果，而且很多时候，是不放弃的希望促成了一个个康复病例的发生。
8. 作者最后的展望是如果AI可以把那些重复的、以数据分析为基础的工作完成，那么人类可以把资源掉配到人文、关怀、心理等需要人与人交流沟通的行业里去，提高整体生活质量。 

就这本书，我个人的一点点想法：在技术界不断发展、升级AI的时候，政府和企业有责任进行一些普及教育，提高各类教育机会，使人们无论在选择学习技术，还是学习人文、历史、心理等方面都有机会，这样，当AI真的有一天像曾经的蒸汽机或者织布机一样替代了工人的时候，我们这些工人还依旧有一些transferable skills从事其他行业。 

书里的内容很多，以上只是我根据记忆稍微整理出来的一些。欢迎讨论。 

## 2. Human Compatible (2019) by Stuart J. Russell

### My extracts from Blinkist:
1. AI is rapidly pervading all levels of society but some AI experts and corporate high-ups are downplaying the risks. 
2. The world fastest computer is the Summit Machine. Computers process faster and faster processing speed to approach or maybe eventually exceeds human brains, but their limitation is the software. The author take AI's ability on comprehension of language as an example. The example is "Call me an ambulance" VS "I'll call you Ann Ambulance". Genuinely intelligent AI will interpret words on their context and tone not the words only. 
3. The current paradigm of AI design is measured simply by how well it can achieve a pre-given objective. But human cannot predict all consequences for an AI to finish the task. Like Elon Mush and Steve Huking's opinion, if AI is given the task to solve global  warming, AI may find out the best solution to eliminate all human beings. The author concludes it is very similar to The King Midas problem. If AI is only given a objective, the AI will have the instinct from being turned off. 
4.  The author thinks we should be designing beneficial machines rather than  intelligent machines. The author called for three principals, the first principle is AI should have only one objective, which is the maximal fulfillment of human preferences; the second principle is that AI should initially be uncertain about what those preferences are; the third principle is AI's ultimate source of information about human preferences should be human behavior (aka the learning principle).    
5.  Autonomous weapons and large scale of surveillance make people's life less secure. 
6.  UBI (Universal basic income) 
7.  AI could be the collaborator at workplaces not purely competitors. 

### My key takeawys
1. AI should not be programmed with a pre-defined goal. This is similar to the android May in the TV series Agents of Shield, who has no idea about her goal is to attain the dark book. 
2. AI's ultimate goal is to satisfying human being's need. ( sounds a bit harsh to the rights of AI)
3. Kaifu-Lee also mentioned UBI in his book AI Superpowers. 

### Some sentenancs/ words to note:
1. the threat becomes more dire.
2. fixate on their feverish quest to realize the utopias of the future. 
3. mitigate its more disastrous consequences
4. computers were being touted as super-brains that are "faster than Einstein"
5. give us a run for our money?
6. The answer is decidedly no. 
7. Most of today's intelligent speed recognition AI are based on canned responses and have trouble interpreting nuances in meaning. 
8. human ingenuity
9. call for altruism principle
10. Infopocalypse
11. a rosy picture
12. burgeoning influence on society

### Summary
I feel like would like to read this book in the future. (***)

## 3. The Economic Singularity: Artificial Intelligence and the death of capitalism (2016) by Calum Chace  

### My extracts from Blinkist:
1. The author compared the trend of using more AI to the use of steam engine in the nineteenth-century. The author provided a valid point that the Industrial Revolution introduced steam engine which empowers machines' abilities in working more effectively. This freed human beings from works producing raw material (like agriculture products) to providing services (like teachers, services workers, etc). 
2. More and more people switching careers to services sections marked the start of Information Revolution. The author drew an analogy between steam engines and AI. AI empowered our previous non-intellectual equipment with analysis and autonomous abilities akin to stream engines harness machines on the assembly line. 
3. The author's opinion is that "machines increases the wealth of nations and do not threaten human employment". The author also provided some statistics from Deloitte (2015) to support his opinion. 
4. The author introduced a software [Quill](https://www.quill.org/) which is developed by Narrative Science in 2010. This software can generate article structure and compose the necessary sentences based on some inputs of short phrases. 
5. The author provided another example [Paro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJq5PQZHU-I), which is a robot looks like a small seal with fur and big eyes. 
6. The author mentioned that suddenly increased unemployment rates caused by AI taking over people's job will lead to economic contraction and "may widen the divide between social classes". 
7. The author also mentioned that UBI could be the solution but joblessness will cause psychological side-effects.  

### My key takeawys
1. Labor intensive jobs will become less if AI has been introduced more broadly in factories, assembly lines, agriculture industries.
2. Keep one's knowledge and skills up to the speed of Information Revolution is the best way to better fit in the future society. 
3. Learn to adapt to a world with AI being part of life.   

### Some sentenancs/ words to note:
1. unfounded 无根据的
2. wreaked(pt.), wreak vi. 发泄；造成 to wreak havoc or damage on sth
3. havoc 大破坏
4. onset n. [常指不快、持久事件的]开始 the onset of sth 某事的来临 the onset of industrial age
5. contraption n. 新奇装置
6. speculate 猜测 
7. onsolete 淘汰的
8. disparity 悬殊的差异
9. nuance: a subtal difference in   

### Summary
I think this book focuses more on the psychological impacts that AI may cause to our society not the technical aspects. (**)   
## 4. Leadership by Algorithm: Who Leads and Who Follows in the AI Era? (2020) by David De Cremer  

### My extracts from Blinkist:
1. AI revolution is coming. In 2016, Google's AlphaGo beat the world board game champions.
2. AI can process huge amount of data to set criteria to improve employee's job satisfaction and performances.
3. But "the ability to lead is beyond the powers of AI". Current AI is not fully capable of cognition which makes them cannot comprehend complex human interactions, which accounts for an important part of management abilities. 
4. The author said human will need to rely on their soft skills, like empathy, agility, and creativity in the future. In short, human should focus on soft skills development to facilitate where AI cannot do.
5. AI could be creativity to some tend but AI will require an enormous amount of raw data, not to mention the algorithm, processing abilities, etc. 
6. The author shares the same idea with the book "Human Compatible" that AI will be a collaborator in workplace not a replacement of human beings.
7. Workers will need to overcome a few prejudices before we can make the most of AI. Like, accepting some errors made by AI and trying to calibrate AI's behaviour.  

### My key takeawys
 Many ideas included in this book is cliché from my point of view. AI can process data at a tremendous speed but is lack of the ability to analysis emotion, showing empathy so could not take over human in workplaces completed. Human and AI should be collaborators not competitors.  

### Some sentenancs/ words to note:
1. innocuous 无意冒犯的；无害的
2. outstrip 比...跑得快；超过
3. poised to be poised to do sth/ for sth为做某事作好准备 AI is poised to enter the world of management. 
4. charisma 非凡的个人魅力
5. agility 敏捷；机敏

### Summary
I may not consider to read this book in the future. (**)
## 5. Architects of Intelligence: The Truth about AI from the People Building it (2016) by Martin Ford  

### My extracts from Blinkist:
Compared to human, AI needs to take a lot more data input to internalize some concepts, which is the limitation of Deep Learning. So the author mentioned a hybird system that used to develop the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). The author thinks AI can make everyone's life better and also warn us about the risk of weaponized AI (like drone or autonomous weapons). The end, the author also mentioned that UBI could be the solution to the problem of job automation. 

### My key takeawys
This book is based on interviews of 20+ engineers and scientists working in AI field which reveals some advanced technologies, including [Affectiva](https://www.affectiva.com/), [semanticscholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/). I share the same idea that AI will aid a lot in healthcare industry. For starters, AI can help doctors to read radiographies quickly, conduct quick checkups and tests, etc. This could free doctors to focus on the patient's emotion. Secondly, some AI powered therapy pets (Like Palo) can comfort senior citizens with dementia.  

### Some sentenancs/ words to note:
1. eradicate 根除；杜绝
2. autism 自闭症
3. stipend 尤指神职人员、教师和公务员的
4. hotly 激烈地
5. 

### Summary
I like this book and will read this one later this year. (***)  
## 6. Superhuman Innovation Transforming Business with Artificial Intelligence (2019) Chris Duffey  

### My extracts from Blinkist:
IBM is funding a project to detect heart failure. Siemens uses neural networks to optimize wind turbines. Deep Thunder developed by IBM and The Weather Channel uses machine learning to examine data and produce location-specific weather forecasts. Experimentation and results are two keys to solve real life challenges. 

### My key takeawys
I like the idea that this book speaks highly for how AI can change and improve our life. 

### Some sentenancs/ words to note:
1. Roman aqueducts

### Summary
I like this book and will read this one later this year. (***)
