Here is the synopsis from Blinkist:

> AI Superpowers (2018) takes a revealing look at the US and China as the world stands at the precipice of the AI economy, a multi-trillion dollar industry of algorithms and automation. As a tech expert and venture capitalist with experience in both China and the US, author Kai-Fu Lee guides us through the past to discover how we got to where we are and what to expect in the future.  

# My extracts from Blinkist:
1. AI is originated from Deep Learning. 
2. China has gone from copycat to top contender in past few years. An great example is "Meituan", founded by Wang Xin who is also the founder of the "Renren", also known as the "Facebook of China". Akin to "Groupon", "Meitun" is a platform where users can purchase vouchers at a lower price compared to retailer price in the shops. But "Meituan" deals not only foods and restaurants, but also other popular vendors like cinemas, spas, arcades, etc to suit local market better. 
3. There are one distinct difference between SV companies and Chinese companies which is as referred by the author, a light or heavy touch. SV companies usually focus on one purpose of their product, like Uber, started with car-sharing and kept this for a few years. While the counterpart "Didi" also focuses on petrol and repair services, which gave users more attachment to the app. 
4. Different means to access Internet Service is the core reason why China companies have a broader product range. Many people in China accessed the Internet using their smart phones (because it could be fairy cheap, like Xiaomi 1 sold at approx. U$200 in 2009). 
5. Chinese preferred to have a centralized app that can deal with all sorts of things, like Wechat. You can send msgs, transfer files and money, pay utilities bills, telephone bills, purchase from different vendors, even upload your Covid-19 test results (nowadays).
6. China is better at Internet AI, whereas USA is better at business AI. USA companies kept more business records compared to China companies, so USA is at a better position to implement business AI, like applying AI to loan applications. China has a great advantage on the large population which can generate enormous data in a few years and those data could be as the source to educate AI program. So the author thinks that China could outperform USA in the future. Some companies (like AntGroup) in China already used AI to analysis loan applications focusing on those who are underserved by traditional banks. 
8. perception AI (voice & facial recognition) VS autonomous AI. If you'd like to treat off some privacy to get a better user experience, my answer would be depends. 
9. If AI will create a utopia or dystopia? Maybe leave for the future to tell.
10. Further to Point 5, this may give SV a delusion that China companies could lose their focus on the core service, which leads to an inaccurate forecast on their performance.

# Below are some of my key takeaways and comments.   
<em>AI Superpowers</em> (2018) 是 Dr. Kai-fu LEE (李开复)写的一本对于 AI 在中、美两国的发展历史、行业现状和未来趋势的书。书的前半部分讲述了中国的 IT 产业发展史，从 90 年代末被成为“中国的 XXX”copy-cat，逐步转型到引领 AI 发展的行业先锋。这本书是先在喜马拉雅上听完中文有声书，根据记忆整理一下我的 takeaways：

1. 互联网行业在中国的发展是从 copy-cat 开始，从王鑫的人人网-中国的“Facebook”、卓越网-中国的“amazon”、美团网-中国的“Groupon”，等等到后来发展出来的滴滴、wechat、tiktok 等；
2. 中国的企业得到国家的大力扶持，包括硬性金融方便补助和一些软性补助，比如落户、孩子上学等，吸引了更多优秀的、dedicate 的技术人员从事互联网行业；
3. 这些政府补助不可避免地存在一些浪费和不能高效进行资本运作的缺点；
3. 中国的创业者和员工可以疯狂地工作以达到产出产品的目的；
4. 因为员工可以疯狂地工作，所以可以达到产品快速根据市场需求迭代、逐步丰富内容、更好地满足市场需求；
5. 90年代和2000年初进入中国的硅谷企业很难适应中国市场。根据作者观点加上我个人理解，我认为有3方面主要原因：
  原因一：对中国市场和用户使用习惯不了解，导致产品不能很好地本地化。
  原因二：中国市场对于硅谷企业是扩展市场，企业会习惯性套用之前的成功运作方案、产品，但是这些产品自带的属性为适应西方使用习惯，回到原因一。
  原因三：对政府政策了解不到位。
6. 作者分别对中、美二国AI的未来进行里展望，我个人认为这不是单独某个国家的发展，而是整个人类的问题，人类要如何面对AI应用对我们已经习惯的生活产生的影响。
7. 作者从自己患病(Stage IV lymphoma) 后治愈（remission）的经历中得到人与人沟通在人类社会里的不可替代性。AI医生可以快速阅读X-ray并进行诊断推测，但是AI（至少目前的AI）无法有人类医生的同情心（同理心）来通知患者诊断结果，而且很多时候，是不放弃的希望促成了一个个康复病例的发生。
8. 作者最后的展望是如果AI可以把那些重复的、以数据分析为基础的工作完成，那么人类可以把资源掉配到人文、关怀、心理等需要人与人交流沟通的行业里去，提高整体生活质量。 

就这本书，我个人的一点点想法：在技术界不断发展、升级AI的时候，政府和企业有责任进行一些普及教育，提高各类教育机会，使人们无论在选择学习技术，还是学习人文、历史、心理等方面都有机会，这样，当AI真的有一天像曾经的蒸汽机或者织布机一样替代了工人的时候，我们这些工人还依旧有一些transferable skills从事其他行业。 

书里的内容很多，以上只是我根据记忆稍微整理出来的一些。欢迎讨论。
