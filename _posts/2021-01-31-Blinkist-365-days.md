# Why started?

I've been using Blinkist for a while and came across a one-year free subscription promotion a few weeks ago. This subscription gave me the access to all premium services at Blinkist. So I thought why not take this opportunity to start what I always wanted to, which is to "sort of" exercise a-book-a-day practice to expend my knowledge in Technology, Business and History and maybe more broadly (let's see how it goes).

I will start a daily update of one book that I am interested in. I am planning to listen/ read the Blinkist of this book and will summary what I've learned. For the books themselves, I either have read or listened to it (maybe both English and Chinese version) or I am just interested in grasp the gist of it. I thought by doing so, I will improve my level of English to be even better than where I am now.
