## Django Structure
# The model layer ("M" of the "MVC")  
Django provides an abstraction layer (the “models”) for structuring and manipulating the data of your Web application.   

# The view layer ("V" of the "MVC")  
Django has the concept of “views” to encapsulate the logic responsible for processing a user’s request and for returning the response. 

# The template layer 
The template layer provides a designer-friendly syntax for rendering the information to be presented to the user.  

# Froms  
Django provides a rich framework to facilitate the creation of forms and the manipulation of form data.
