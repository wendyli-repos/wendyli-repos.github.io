# My extracts from Blinkist:
1. AI revolution is coming. In 2016, Google's AlphaGo beat the world board game champions.
2. AI can process huge amount of data to set criteria to improve employee's job satisfaction and performances.
3. But "the ability to lead is beyond the powers of AI". Current AI is not fully capable of cognition which makes them cannot comprehend complex human interactions, which accounts for an important part of management abilities. 
4. The author said human will need to rely on their soft skills, like empathy, agility, and creativity in the future. In short, human should focus on soft skills development to facilitate where AI cannot do.
5. AI could be creativity to some tend but AI will require an enormous amount of raw data, not to mention the algorithm, processing abilities, etc. 
6. The author shares the same idea with the book "Human Compatible" that AI will be a collaborator in workplace not a replacement of human beings.
7. Workers will need to overcome a few prejudices before we can make the most of AI. Like, accepting some errors made by AI and trying to calibrate AI's behaviour.  

# My key takeawys
 Many ideas included in this book is cliché from my point of view. AI can process data at a tremendous speed but is lack of the ability to analysis emotion, showing empathy so could not take over human in workplaces completed. Human and AI should be collaborators not competitors.  

# Some sentenancs/ words to note:
1. innocuous 无意冒犯的；无害的
2. outstrip 比...跑得快；超过
3. poised to be poised to do sth/ for sth为做某事作好准备 AI is poised to enter the world of management. 
4. charisma 非凡的个人魅力
5. agility 敏捷；机敏

# Summary
I may not consider to read this book in the future. (**)
