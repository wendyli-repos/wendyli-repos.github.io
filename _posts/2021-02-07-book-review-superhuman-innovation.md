# My extracts from Blinkist:
IBM is funding a project to detect heart failure. Siemens uses neural networks to optimize wind turbines. Deep Thunder developed by IBM and The Weather Channel uses machine learning to examine data and produce location-specific weather forecasts. Experimentation and results are two keys to solve real life challenges.
