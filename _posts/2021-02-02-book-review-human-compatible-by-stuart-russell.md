# My extracts from Blinkist:
1. AI is rapidly pervading all levels of society but some AI experts and corporate high-ups are downplaying the risks. 
2. The world fastest computer is the Summit Machine. Computers process faster and faster processing speed to approach or maybe eventually exceeds human brains, but their limitation is the software. The author take AI's ability on comprehension of language as an example. The example is "Call me an ambulance" VS "I'll call you Ann Ambulance". Genuinely intelligent AI will interpret words on their context and tone not the words only. 
3. The current paradigm of AI design is measured simply by how well it can achieve a pre-given objective. But human cannot predict all consequences for an AI to finish the task. Like Elon Mush and Steve Huking's opinion, if AI is given the task to solve global  warming, AI may find out the best solution to eliminate all human beings. The author concludes it is very similar to The King Midas problem. If AI is only given a objective, the AI will have the instinct from being turned off. 
4.  The author thinks we should be designing beneficial machines rather than  intelligent machines. The author called for three principals, the first principle is AI should have only one objective, which is the maximal fulfillment of human preferences; the second principle is that AI should initially be uncertain about what those preferences are; the third principle is AI's ultimate source of information about human preferences should be human behavior (aka the learning principle).    
5.  Autonomous weapons and large scale of surveillance make people's life less secure. 
6.  UBI (Universal basic income) 
7.  AI could be the collaborator at workplaces not purely competitors. 

# My key takeawys
1. AI should not be programmed with a pre-defined goal. This is similar to the android May in the TV series Agents of Shield, who has no idea about her goal is to attain the dark book. 
2. AI's ultimate goal is to satisfying human being's need. ( sounds a bit harsh to the rights of AI)
3. Kaifu-Lee also mentioned UBI in his book AI Superpowers. 

# Some sentenancs/ words to note:
1. the threat becomes more dire.
2. fixate on their feverish quest to realize the utopias of the future. 
3. mitigate its more disastrous consequences
4. computers were being touted as super-brains that are "faster than Einstein"
5. give us a run for our money?
6. The answer is decidedly no. 
7. Most of today's intelligent speed recognition AI are based on canned responses and have trouble interpreting nuances in meaning. 
8. human ingenuity
9. call for altruism principle
10. Infopocalypse
11. a rosy picture
12. burgeoning influence on society

# Summary
I feel like would like to read this book in the future. (***)
