# Hi,

welcome to my blog!

Here, I keep notes<span>&#128394;</span> on learning IT stuff; also some brillant ideas<span>&#128161;</span> and awasome projects<span >&#x1F5A5;</span> .

# Before me

7 years of working experience in all spacturum of Construction industry taught me one thing that techonology is the key for the future. Even for a traditional insudtry like Constrtion is starting to embrace tech in modeling, desiging, estimating and project managements and so on. 

# Now me
I am learning Web Development to start my journey of a complete career change into IT industry. The most fascnitating thing I like about Web Development is that no need to download or install anything before I can present greate things.

# Skillset

I am using
{% assign categories_list = site.categories %}
{%- for category in categories_list -%}
<span style="display: inline-block; ">{{ category[0] }}, </span>
{% endfor %}.
